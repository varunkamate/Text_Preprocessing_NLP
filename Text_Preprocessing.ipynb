Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes.

As a drama the movie is watchable. Parents are divorcing & arguing like in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film! I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie, and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots.<br /><br />3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.\""

no. i laughed. i cried. not a single moment of cheese. proof that this isn't a hollywood movie.<br /><br />my favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when cristy is discussing painters with eileen, peter and her friends. here's where daniel day-lewis reaches an acting climax. \\\"i'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated.\\\" \\\"wheel out the cripple!\\\" and his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. simply. he has a lot of screen time here. i watch it again again, and i never get tired of cristy's perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches.<br /><br />a must-see. fo sho, yo!\",\n          \"kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i've ever seen. sort of like a high school film project. what was rosanna arquette thinking??

no. i laughed. i cried. not a single moment of cheese. proof that this isn't a hollywood movie.my favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when cristy is discussing painters with eileen, peter and her friends. here's where daniel day-lewis reaches an acting climax. \\\"i'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated.\\\" \\\"wheel out the cripple!\\\" and his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. simply. he has a lot of screen time here. i watch it again again, and i never get tired of cristy's perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches.a must-see. fo sho, yo!\",\n          \"kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i've ever seen. sort of like a high school film project. what was rosanna arquette thinking??

no. i laughed. i cried. not a single moment of cheese. proof that this isn't a hollywood movie.my favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when cristy is discussing painters with eileen, peter and her friends. here's where daniel day-lewis reaches an acting climax. \\\"i'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated.\\\" \\\"wheel out the cripple!\\\" and his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. simply. he has a lot of screen time here. i watch it again again, and i never get tired of cristy's perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches.a must-see. fo sho, yo!\",\n          \"kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i've ever seen. sort of like a high school film project. what was rosanna arquette thinking??

no. i laughed. i cried. not a single moment of cheese. proof that this isn't a hollywood movie.my favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when cristy is discussing painters with eileen, peter and her friends. here's where daniel day-lewis reaches an acting climax. \\\"i'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated.\\\" \\\"wheel out the cripple!\\\" and his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. simply. he has a lot of screen time here. i watch it again again, and i never get tired of cristy's perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches.a must-see. fo sho, yo!\",\n          \"kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i've ever seen. sort of like a high school film project. what was rosanna arquette thinking??
